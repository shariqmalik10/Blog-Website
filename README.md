# Blog Website 
This is a website that can be used to read and write blogs. It is currently at a very early stage of development as the progress of the project will be directly tied to the progress I am making with my web dev learning journey  
The website is designed using CSS, EJS, NodeJS+ExpressJS  
A preview will be available soon once I host the website on Netlify (cannot host on GitHub pages as it only hosts static websites hence no support for server side rendering). 

### Stuff that needs to be worked on 

- [ ] Integrating PostGres to be used to store the data for each user's blog entry 
- [ ] improving the design and placement of the add button
- [ ] Adding a login system 
- [ ] Doing a complete rehaul of the UI once I learn React 
- [ ] Add the ability to continue writing on the next line
- [ ] Make the text area for content writing dynamic 
- [ ] Add a line to add date to each post
